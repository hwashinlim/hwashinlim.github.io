## About

I'm a research scientist at Meta Reality Labs, where I pioneer innovative AR solutions to overcome current optical challenges. With expertise in holography, light field, near-eye display, and visual perception, I had published over 28 research articles in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Before joining Meta, I had worked for 2 years at Samsung Research, where I was also dedicated to develop AR glasses technologies.

## My research interests and expertise include

- **Optical system development for AR glasses** 
- **End-to-end optical modeling to comprehend the perceptual impact from the complex system**
- **Computational 3D displays and imaging, including holography and light field** 
- **Optical component development (e.g., liquid crystal or holographic optical elements)** 

## Experience

- **Research Scientist** <br>
  <span style="color:gray;">Meta (Jun 2022 - Present)</span>
   - Led a perceptual testbed development for the pupil steering system applicable for AR/VR systems. Designed a perceptual model that comprehensively predicts the visual artifacts raised by the pupil steering. (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3641519.3657486"><u>academic paper</u></a>)
- **Staff Engineer** <br>
  <span style="color:gray;">Samsung Electronics (Sep 2020 - Apr 2022)</span>
   - Developed AR glasses solution that supports adaptive focus that stimulates accurate accommodation.
   - Implemented a wave optics simulation pipeline to minimize the perceptual artifacts from the AR glasses eye piece.
- **Contingent Worker**<br>
  <span style="color:gray;">Facebook Reality Labs (Dec 2019 - Jun 2020)</span>
  - Published the academic research paper, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-72555-w"><u>"Foveated near-eye display for mixed reality using liquid crystal photonics"</u></a>, at Scientific Reports.
- **Visiting Researcher**<br>
  <span style="color:gray;">Facebook Reality Labs (Mar 2019 - Sep 2019)</span>
   - Designed the optical system and implemented a prototype for a foveated near-eye display system leveraging holography, polarization optics, and liquid crystal optics.
   - Developed a novel exposure system with the polarization management, extending the design and fabrication capability of the liquid crystal elements.
