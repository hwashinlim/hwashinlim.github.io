## About

I'm a research scientist at Meta Reality Labs, where I pioneer innovative AR solutions to overcome current optical challenges. With expertise in holography, light field, near-eye display, and visual perception, I had published over 28 research articles in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Before joining Meta, I had worked for 2 years at Samsung Research, where I was also dedicated to develop AR glasses technologies.

## My research interests and expertise include

- **Optical system development for AR glasses** 
- **End-to-end optical modeling to comprehend the perceptual impact from the complex system**
- **Computational 3D displays and imaging, including holography and light field** 
- **Optical component development (e.g., liquid crystal or holographic optical elements)**
